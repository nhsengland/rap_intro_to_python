# How to use python on the terminal

Before we look at using python files, first we are going to use python in the terminal.


## Checking Python Installation
For this to work Python must already be installed in the enviornment you are working in. It is pre-installed in UDAL.

To check if Python is installed and to see the version, open your terminal and type:

```
python --version
```


Step 1:
Type into your terminal:

```
python
```

This should open up something that looks like this:

From here you can type commands straight into the terminal!

Try typing in a simple sum:

```
50 * 10
```
And it will return the answer! It can do this for any mathematical operation

It can also print things to the terminal:

Trying typing something like this - and remember the quotation marks!:

```
print("Hello World!")
```

This is all well and good, but what about storing variables?

Try storing a variable *greeting* by assigning it, using the = operator

```
greeting = "Hello World!"
```
