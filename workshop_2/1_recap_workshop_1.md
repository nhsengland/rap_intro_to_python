The order to go through the files in this workshop is is:

1. recap_workshop_1.md (this one)
2. recap_workshop_1.ipynb
3. conditional_logic.ipynb
4. loops.ipynb
5. homework.ipynb

**Your task is to run the python file called run_me.py using the terminal**

Double check your terminal is in the correct area using commands like:

pwd - to check your present directory
ls - to see the list of files available in your current directory
cd {folder_name} - to change your current directory

To run a file from the terminal:
python {path/to/file}


If you're in the root directory of this repository your path/to/file will include the folder that this file sits in.
So therefore you would run:

python workshop_2/run_me.py

Tip: If you start typing a folder or file, and press the Tab button, it should finish it for you (as long as you don't have more files with similar names)
